# Vehicle Agent Standard (VAS)

**An open protocol for communication between vehicle agents.**

This specification defines a message structure and communication conventions for intelligent agents (LLMs, connected systems, embedded software) to exchange useful information between vehicles, fleets, and platforms.

---

## üåê Objectives

- Define a common format for communication between vehicle agents.
- Facilitate interoperability between different agent implementations.
- Enable a decentralized, collaborative network of vehicle assistants.

## üßæ Example: Query and Response Between Agents

### 1. `query`: Request for a recommended workshop in Zaragoza

```json
{
  "message_type": "query",
  "sender_id": "vehicle:ABC123",
  "receiver_id": "vehicle:XYZ987",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-02T17:00:00Z",
  "query": {
    "type": "recommendation",
    "topic": "maintenance_shop",
    "location": "Zaragoza"
  }
}
```

### 2. `response`: Recommendation returned

```json
{
  "message_type": "response",
  "sender_id": "vehicle:XYZ987",
  "receiver_id": "vehicle:ABC123",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-02T17:01:12Z",
  "response": {
    "type": "recommendation",
    "data": {
      "name": "Bosch Service Zaragoza",
      "rating": 4.7,
      "last_used": "2024-12-10"
